# lem_in

**Project score : [125 / 100]**

Lem-in is an algorithmic project that rely upon graph theory to find the shortest paths from a point A to a point B. Each route has a maximum capacity, so we used the Edmund-Karp algorithm to improve our results.

## About lem-in

At the beginning from standart output the program recieves information about number of ants had to be leaded through path, room names (can be numbers, words, characters etc.) with coordinates and links. Here is an example:

Comments "##start" and "##end" are provided to show the start and end room information. We don't care about any other comments.

## Installation and usage

```
git clone https://github.com/barthelemyleveque/lem_in && cd lem_in && make
./lem-in < maps/[ONE_OF_THE_MAPS]
```

For example, if you execute maps/big, the program output will be :

L0 <=> first ant ; L1 <=> second ant ; up to L99 <=> hundredth ant

In the first line you have L0-99 which means the first ant goes to room "99", then L1-806 which means the second ant goes to room "806" etc. 

The rules of lem-in state that there can be only one ant in a room at a time. Which cause superposition problems that were fixed using a custon Edmond-Karps algorithm and graph theory.
